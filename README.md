This is the whole code and images I used to create different projects during my internship in Web Development at CodSoft.

TASK 1- My first task was to create my own Portfolio. I have built this using HTML and CSS in which I have inserted my image to enhance the outlook of the portfolio, added different sections like header section, skills section, resume section, contact information, etc..

TASK 2- This was to create a landing page to showcase my skills of HTML and CSS.Through this task I have learnt to create columns, divide sections, arrange items, and add headers and footers.  In this I have Paid more attention to alignments, padding, color palette, boxes, and other elements. I have kept this page very simple while ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design. 

TASK 3- This project was to create a working calculator using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.In this I've implemented an interactive interface with buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations. I have used CSS grid system for button alignments. The calculator has a display screen to show user input and results. 

This experience has been incredible, enhancing my skills in web development and allowing me to gain hands-on experience in creating user-friendly and responsive designs.
